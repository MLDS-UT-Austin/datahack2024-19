## How to Run

For the code, run freeAgencyFinal.py first, then run WARCaclulations.py, then run astrosWarCalculations.py, then run allocatedbudget.py, and finally run submission.py. This will result in submission.csv. (These are the main ones, the rest are helper files, alternative sample iterations, or visualizations)
